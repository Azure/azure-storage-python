Microsoft Azure Storage SDK for Python
======================================

This project provides a client library in Python that makes it easy to
consume Microsoft Azure Storage services. For documentation please see
the Microsoft Azure `Python Developer Center`_ and our `API Reference`_ Page.

    If you are looking for the Service Bus or Azure Management
    libraries, please visit
    https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python.


Compatibility
=============

**IMPORTANT**: If you have an earlier version of the azure package
(version < 1.0), you should uninstall it before installing this package.

You can check the version using pip:

.. code:: shell

    pip freeze

If you see azure==0.11.0 (or any version below 1.0), uninstall it first then install it again:

.. code:: shell

    pip uninstall azure
    pip install azure

If you are upgrading from a version older than 0.30.0, see the upgrade doc, the 
usage samples in the samples directory, and the ChangeLog and BreakingChanges.

**IMPORTANT**: If you have an earlier version of the azure-storage package
(version <= 0.36.0), you should uninstall it before installing the new packages.

You can check the version using pip:

.. code:: shell

    pip freeze

If you see azure-storage==0.35.1 (or any version below 0.35.1), uninstall it first:

.. code:: shell

    pip uninstall azure-storage

Getting Started
===============

Download
--------

The Azure Storage SDK for Python is composed of 4 packages, each corresponding to a different service:
- azure-storage-blob
- azure-storage-file
- azure-storage-queue
- azure-storage-table

Note: prior to version 0.36.0, there used to be a single package (azure-storage) containing all services

Option 1: Via PyPi
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To install via the Python Package Index (PyPI), type:
::

    pip install azure-storage-blob
    pip install azure-storage-file
    pip install azure-storage-queue
    pip install azure-storage-table

Option 2: Source Via Git
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To get the source code of the SDK via git just type:

::

    git clone git://github.com/Azure/azure-storage-python.git
    cd ./azure-storage-python/azure-storage-blob
    python setup.py install


Replace azure-storage-blob with azure-storage-file, azure-storage-queue, or azure-storage-table to install the other services.

Option 3: Source Zip
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Download a zip of the code via GitHub or PyPi. Then, type:

::

    cd ./azure-storage-python/azure-storage-blob
    python setup.py install


Replace azure-storage-blob with azure-storage-file, azure-storage-queue, or azure-storage-table to install the other services.

Minimum Requirements
--------------------

-  Python 2.7, 3.3, 3.4, 3.5, or 3.6.
